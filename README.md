# 📐 Click 3 Points & Measure Angle Using OpenCV (Python)

This project demonstrates an **interactive angle measurement tool** built using **Python and OpenCV**, where users can calculate the angle between three points on an image by clicking directly on the image.

It is a beginner-friendly **computer vision project** that helps in understanding mouse events, vector mathematics, and geometric calculations in images.

## 🚀 Features
- Click **three points** on an image to measure the angle
- Real-time visualization with points and connecting lines
- Accurate angle calculation using **vector math**
- Reset selected points anytime
- Save the final annotated image
- Simple and clean OpenCV implementation

## 📌 How It Works
1. Load an image using OpenCV
2. Capture mouse click coordinates
3. Form vectors between the selected points
4. Calculate the angle using dot product and cosine rule
5. Display the angle on the image
